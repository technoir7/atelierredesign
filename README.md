# Atelier School of Classical Realism - Website Redesign

A prestigious redesign of the Atelier School of Classical Realism website focusing on elegance, sophistication, and classical aesthetics while providing modern functionality.

## Project Overview

This redesign aims to elevate the digital presence of the Atelier School of Classical Realism, showcasing the school's dedication to traditional art education through a modern, sophisticated website that reflects the timeless quality of classical art training.

## Design Principles

The redesign follows these core design principles:

1. **Sophisticated Typography**: Utilizes a carefully selected pairing of Cormorant Garamond (serif) and Montserrat (sans-serif) to create a refined typographic hierarchy.

2. **Restrained Color Palette**: Features a limited color scheme of deep charcoal, antique gold, and warm neutrals that conveys elegance and timelessness.

3. **Intentional White Space**: Incorporates generous negative space to allow content to breathe and focus attention on high-quality imagery.

4. **Visual Consistency**: Maintains cohesive design elements throughout the site for a unified experience.

5. **Subtle Animations**: Includes refined micro-interactions that enhance the user experience without distracting from content.
